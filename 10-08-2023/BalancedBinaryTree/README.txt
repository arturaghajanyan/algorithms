* Balanced Binary Search trees are performance-wise good as they provide O(log n) time for search, insert and delete.
* A balanced binary tree is a binary tree that follows the 3 conditions:
    - The height of the left and right tree for any node does not differ by more than 1.
    - The left subtree of that node is also balanced.
    - The right subtree of that node is also balanced.
* Application of Balanced Binary Tree:
    - AVL Trees
    - Red Black Tree
    - Balanced Binary Search Tree
* Advantages of Balanced Binary Tree:
    - Non Destructive updates are supported by a Balanced Binary Tree with the same asymptotic effectiveness.
    - Range queries and iteration in the right sequence are made feasible by the balanced binary tree.
